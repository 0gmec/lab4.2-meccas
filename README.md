# Array Manipulation Lab Reflection

## How did array methods like push and filter help?

Using push, I was able to add new items to my shopping list array easily. The filter method helped me search for specific items, returning only those that matched what I was looking for. If nothing matched, it returned an empty array which let me know the item wasn’t there.

## What challenges did you face when filtering or searching?

One of the biggest challenges was figuring out how to make the search case-insensitive at first, which made filtering frustrating. I also struggled with how includes() worked until I realized how to apply it inside  filter() correctly.

## How would you make the code more user-friendly?

I’d add a message that says “Item not found” when the array returns empty, just to make it clearer. I’d also clean the input using  .toLowerCase() so the search is smoother and less strict about how the user types things.

## Personal Reflection

This lab definitely got tedious and frustrating at times, especially when my search wasn’t working the way I expected. But I pushed through by going back to Module 4, rereading examples, and clicking through links to better understand how these methods actually work. I learned a lot by testing things out and problem-solving on my own.
